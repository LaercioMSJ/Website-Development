        <h3>Decide the Fate of the World</h3>

        <p>
            &emsp; <strong>Alliance</strong> challenges you and your opponents to decide the outcome. As one of the world powers 
            battling for supremacy you must lead your country's military drive; but you can't do it alone. 
            You have to form alliances and then betray your allies before they betray you!
        </p>

        <p>
            &emsp;Decide where to strike, when to strike, and the intensity of the strike. Will it be a bombing 
            raid, an offshore missile barrage, or an invasion with land forces and tanks? Plan your attack, 
            move into enemy territory with your forces and win the conflict.
        </p>

        <p>
            &emsp;The economic destiny of your nation is also at stake. Buy armaments and develop secret 
            weapons from your country's economic funds and natural reserves, but be sure to save 
            something for the future.

            <h3>Tedious and Confusing</h3>

            <p>
                &emsp;The list of war simulation games is long. All of them share similar features including the 
                formation of temporary Alliance and battles simulated through random draws of a deck or the 
                roll of the die. Alliance offers very little that is new or innovative in that regard.
            </p>

            <p>
                &emsp;We found the game to be too drawn-out and confusing. In fact, I dare say we spent more time 
                reading and rereading the rule book than actually playing the game. If you want to read a 
                book on war, we suggest Sun Tzu.

            <h3>Decent Game but Many are Better</h3>

            <p>
                &emsp;Alliance is a good war simulation game. We found the game play to be robust and engaging. The 
                rules are long and drawn out but, for anyone with experience in this class of board games, there 
                is little there that's unexpected or difficult. We think the battle simulation cards are some of 
                the best we have encountered.
            </p>

            <p>
                &emsp;All of that being said, the competition for this type of game is fierce. There are a lot of 
                established titles with loyal clients. We're not exactly sure where Alliance fits in with 
                that group. It's a good game, but not good enough to draw our attention away from games like 
                Battle Tested and Global Conflict.

            <h3>Fun and Challenging</h3>

            <p>
                &emsp;Alliance is fun game and is sure to appeal to war game enthusiasts. We think it offers several new 
                ideas that we're surprised have not been utilized in other simulation games. The card system and the 
                investment options give the game a "real world" feel.

                &emsp;This is a great game for anyone 16 years or older. Younger players may have trouble with the rules and may be bored
