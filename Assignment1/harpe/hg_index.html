		<h3>Welcome to Harpe Gaming. We have a simple philosophy. It has three main points:</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Unplug</li>
			<li>Interact</li>
			<li>Reconnect</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			&emsp;And that's it. We believe that the best games are the ones that bring people together through <b>shared experiences</b>.
			With all due respect to our video gamer friends, you can't always get that from a computer screen. Sometimes you need the
			intimate approach of sitting face-to-face around a common table with the soda and chips at your elbow.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			&emsp;We are a local board and card game store located in the heart of <strong>Morgantown</strong> near the campus.
			We carry hundreds of games and puzzles, including <em>educational games, family games, card games, historical
			simulations, role-playing games</em>, and so much more. If you remember a great game from your youth, we
			probably have it in our antiques collection. If we don't, we know where we can get it.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			&emsp;We're more than just a place to buy games. We celebrate gaming and the company of good friends.
			Our game room is free for all to us. Sit down, pick out a game from our demo library and start playing.
			We sponsor <i>tournaments, challenges, and special social events</i>. You'll always find a game to play.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			&emsp;We're always on the lookout for the best new games. We publish periodic reviews of new titles. Just out 
			our reviews of <strong>Towers and Temples</strong> and <strong>Alliance</strong>;
			both new this month at <strong>Harpe Gaming</strong>.
